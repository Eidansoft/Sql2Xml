# Sql2Xml
A PHP Script to get a SQL results into XML format.

My idea is to get an easy way to get data from my MySql server.
The problem is that the MySql server is only avaiable for the php web-hosted applications. This usually 
happens whe you have an account for a web server hosting with MySql.
Another solution is use any free MySql servers, but I prefer to store my data on my own.
For this reason I write this php code to recieve an SQL sentence, execute it and returns the results
into XML format.
